# Filename: Console_File_Manager_DMS.py

""" Purpose: This Python script implements the basic file / directory handling features
that a user would expect in a file manager type application. 

I didn't code the base functionailty (found code on the web). However, I hope to
extend it with my own feature editions. Originally posted to the website
www.codegeek,io by Nabarun Roy (July 2016).

# todo list for new functionality

# File / directory compare - not fully implemented yet
# File archiving operations - not implemented yet
# Disk usage statistics - not implemented yet

# Changelog

# 7/23/2017 - 

# Menu item #5 does not appear to work correctly. Need to check on this one.

# Menu item #6 partially fixed. Will find an existing directory, but not an existing file. Returns "file not found". Update - #6 seems to be fixed now.
# Will need more testing.

# 7/24/2017 -

# Menu item #5 fixed and tested. Needs paging for long output (using either OS 'more' or 'less' or Python 'subprocess' or 'Popen') into this function.

# Menu item # 6 fixed and tested.

# 7/26/2017 - 

# Worked on implementing file / directory compare

# File compare is working. Directory compare still not functional yet.

# 8/01/2017 -

# Directory compare is now working

# 8/03/2017 -

# File archiving function is complete and working

# 8/7/2017

# Disk usage function

# Returned results are displayed in bytes, so not super user-friendly.

# First, we should import some needed modules.
